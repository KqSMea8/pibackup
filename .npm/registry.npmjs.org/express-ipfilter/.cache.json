A light-weight IP address based filtering system\n=================================================================================\n\nThis package provides easy IP based access control. This can be achieved either by blacklisting certain IPs and whitelisting all others, or whitelisting certain IPs and blacklisting all others.\n\n[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/baminteractive/express-ipfilter/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/baminteractive/express-ipfilter/tree/master)\n\n## Version\n0.3.1\n\n## Installation\n\nRecommended installation is with npm. To add node-ipfilter to your project, do:\n\n    npm install express-ipfilter\n\n## Usage with Express\n\n> NOTE: Starting with version 0.1.0, allow forwarded IP addresses through headers (forward, Cloudflare, Codio) are disabled by **default**. You must explicitly enable them by adding them to the `allowedHeaders` list.\n\nBlacklisting certain IP addresses, while allowing all other IPs:\n\n```javascript\n// Init dependencies\nvar express = require('express'),\n    ipfilter = require('express-ipfilter').IpFilter;\n\n// Blacklist the following IPs\nvar ips = ['127.0.0.1'];\n\n// Create the server\napp.use(ipfilter(ips));\napp.listen(3000);\n```\n\nWhitelisting certain IP addresses, while denying all other IPs:\n\n```javascript\n// Init dependencies\n// Init dependencies\nvar express = require('express'),\n    ipfilter = require('express-ipfilter').IpFilter;\n\n// Whitelist the following IPs\nvar ips = ['127.0.0.1'];\n\n// Create the server\napp.use(ipfilter(ips, {mode: 'allow'}));\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n```\n\nUsing CIDR subnet masks for ranges:\n\n```javascript\nvar ips = ['127.0.0.1/24'];\n\n// Create the server\napp.use(ipfilter(ips, {mode: 'allow'}));\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n```\n\nUsing IP ranges:\n\n```javascript\nvar ips = [['127.0.0.1','127.0.0.10']];\n\n// Create the server\napp.use(ipfilter(ips, {mode: 'allow'}));\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n```\n\nUsing a function to get Ips:\n\n```javascript\nvar ips = function() { return ['127.0.0.1']; };\n\n// Create the server\napp.use(ipfilter(ips, {mode: 'allow'}));\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\nWhen an IP is denied, an IpDeniedError will be thrown by the middleware. If you do not handle the error, it will cause your app to crash due to an unhandled exception. Here is an example of how to handle the error, which can also be found in the example app:\n\n```\nif (app.get('env') === 'development') {\n  app.use(function(err, req, res, _next) {\n    console.log('Error handler', err);\n    if(err instanceof IpDeniedError){\n      res.status(401);\n    }else{\n      res.status(err.status || 500);\n    }\n\n    res.render('error', {\n      message: 'You shall not pass',\n      error: err\n    });\n  });\n}\n```\n\nYou will need to require the `IpDeniedError` type in order to handle it.\n\n\n## Options\n\n| Property      | Description   | Type  | Default|\n| ------------- |-------------| -----|--------|\n| mode   | whether to *deny* or *allow* to the IPs provided | string|deny|\n| log   | console log actions | boolean|true|\n| logLevel | level of logging (*all*,*deny*,*allow*) | string | all\n| allowedHeaders | an array of strings for header names that are acceptable for retrieving an IP address | array | [] |\n| excluding   | routes that should be excluded from ip filtering | array|[]|\n| detectIp | define a custom function that takes an Express request object and returns an IP address to test against | function | built-in detection |\n\n> A note on detectIp\n\nIf you need to parse an IP address in a way that is not supported by default, you can write your own parser and pass that to `ipfilter`.\n\n```\nfunction customDetection(req){\n  var ipAddress;\n\n  ipAddress = req.connection.remoteAddress.replace(/\\//g, '.');\n\n  return ipAddress;\n}\n\nipfilter(ids, {detectIp: customDetection});\n\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee the `CONTRIBUTING.MD` document for more information on contributing.\n\n### Building from source\n\nYou can run `grunt` to build the source.  This will run `eslint` and `babel` against `src/ipfilter.js`.\n\nThere is an included `example` project that will load the package from the local build for testing.\n\n### Running Tests\n\nRun tests by using\n\n`grunt test`\n\nThis will run `eslint`,`babel`, and `mocha` and output coverage data into `coverage`.  Any pull request you submit needs to be accompanied by a test.\n\n## Changelog\n\n0.3.1\n * Fixes critical bug that allowed access when ips is empty and mode == 'allow'.\n * Adds minor speed improvements for middleware.\n * Minor spelling and documentation fixes in README\n\n0.3.0\n * Adds the ability to pass IPs by function so that we can dynamically retrieve white/black listed addresses.\n\n0.2.6\n- Minor change to the Contributing Guidelines to include updating the version numbers\n\n0.2.5\n* Added fields `status` and `statusCode` to the IpDeniedError object, which both equal `403`.\n\n0.2.4\n* For IPv4 addresses that have a port (as experienced with Azure web apps), the port is now stripped before comparing it with the contents of the whitelist or blacklist. Fixes issue #49.\n\n0.2.3\n* Fixed a bug that sent all logging through instead of just denied requests\n\n0.2.2\n* Added a customization point for IP detection\n* Fixed a bug with IPv4 over IPv6\n\n0.2.1\n* Add log level property.\n\n0.2.0\n* Changed how error handling works\n* Removed settings for specific vendor ip addresses and added `allowedHeaders` to support those header-based IP addresses.\n* You must now specifically require `IpFilter`, i.e. `var ipfilter = require('express-ipfilter').IpFilter;`\n* If you want to handle errors you must require the error type as well `var IpDeniedError = require('express-ipfilter').IpDeniedError;`\n\n0.1.1\n* Added a favicon to the example to suppress the 404 error looking for it.\n\n0.1.0\n* Changed default behavior of the library to disable reading forwarded IP headers. They must now be explicitly enabled.\n* Using `res.send` when a failure occurs to allow for different formats of `errorMessage`\n\n0.0.25\n* Switched from netmask to range_check (uses ipaddr.js)\n* Added support for IPv6 CIDR\n* Fixed issue with mixed IPv4 and IPv6 rules\n\n0.0.24\n* Added lib to version control\n\n0.0.23\n* added codio x-real-ip header\n\n0.0.22\n\n* Added IPv6 Support\n* Added build tools\n* Added test coverage and reporting\n\n0.0.20\n\n* Added a setting to explicitly allow CloudFlare and Forwarded IPs.  By default they are set to not allow these headers.  Thanks to @longstone!\n\n0.0.19\n\n* Added detection for CloudFlare forwarded ips - https://github.com/baminteractive/express-ipfilter/commit/9aa43af14f5a003bad3145eef658f429808818f9 (@lafama)\n\n0.0.18\n\n* Fixing bug when array of CIDR blocks are used\n\n0.0.16\n\n* Fixing bug when no IP address can be determined\n\n0.0.15\n\n* Minor bug fix\n\n0.0.14\n\n* Adding the ability to have exclusion urls\n\n0.0.12\n\n* Diagnostic Options\n\n0.0.11\n\n* Bug Fix for port logic\n\n0.0.10\n\n* Added support for IPs with port numbers\n\n0.0.9\n\n* Fixing deploy issues\n\n0.0.8\n\n* Auto deploys for npm\n\n0.0.7\n\n* Add support ip ranges.\n\n0.0.6\n\n* Fixed a bug when using console output\n\n0.0.5\n\n* Added ability to block by subnet mask (i.e. 127.0.0.1/24)\n* Added tests for cidr functionality\n\n0.0.4\n\n* Add tests\n* Update docs\n* Refactor, and restyle\n\n0.0.1\n\n* First revision\n\n## Credits\n\nBaM Interactive - [code.bamideas.com](http://code.bamideas.com)\n","maintainers":[{"name":"ryanbillingsley","email":"ryanbbillingsley@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-09-22T06:40:00.865Z","created":"2014-02-05T20:45:22.662Z","0.0.5":"2014-02-05T20:45:23.434Z","0.0.6":"2014-02-10T14:46:49.906Z","0.0.9":"2014-02-12T22:06:04.792Z","0.0.10":"2014-02-17T17:51:52.992Z","0.0.11":"2014-02-17T17:58:16.229Z","0.0.12":"2014-02-17T18:09:47.453Z","0.0.13":"2014-02-19T16:47:14.287Z","0.0.14":"2014-02-19T17:29:51.303Z","0.0.15":"2014-02-19T17:32:51.733Z","0.0.16":"2014-02-21T14:16:04.774Z","0.0.17":"2014-03-20T22:08:02.547Z","0.0.18":"2014-12-17T19:40:25.745Z","0.0.19":"2015-02-09T22:21:13.911Z","0.0.20":"2015-08-13T14:14:37.110Z","0.0.21":"2015-11-19T16:41:35.996Z","0.0.22":"2015-11-19T18:17:56.478Z","0.0.23":"2015-11-19T18:34:38.667Z","0.0.24":"2015-11-23T14:24:23.903Z","0.0.25":"2016-03-22T14:53:45.295Z","0.1.0":"2016-08-10T15:55:51.077Z","0.1.1":"2016-08-22T15:11:50.094Z","0.2.0":"2016-09-04T00:38:25.436Z","0.2.1":"2016-11-06T21:06:20.075Z","0.2.2":"2017-02-13T21:48:54.371Z","0.2.3":"2017-02-14T15:18:32.004Z","0.2.4":"2017-04-11T20:22:16.365Z","0.2.5":"2017-06-28T14:50:34.303Z","0.2.6":"2017-07-11T20:19:23.015Z","0.3.0":"2017-07-12T02:28:45.976Z","0.3.1":"2017-07-13T17:29:22.067Z"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","author":{"name":"BaM Interactive"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+ssh://git@github.com/baminteractive/express-ipfilter.git"},"keywords":["middleware","ipfilter","ip filter","ipban","ip ban","express"],"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/baminteractive/express-ipfilter/issues"},"license":"MIT","homepage":"https://github.com/baminteractive/express-ipfilter#readme","users":{"longstone":true,"awzm":true,"chrisaiv":true,"ozziest":true,"sylvain261":true,"oliverj":true,"itskdk":true,"alrico88":true,"rocket0191":true,"paraself":true,"h6rdworker":true,"dongguangming":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"59c4b040-bb93\"","_lastModified":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 06:40:00 GMT"}
